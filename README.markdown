Driver is for setting up your passenger vhosts. Kind of like Passenger Pref Pane, but less hangy.

## Install

First off you're going to need to install the `sinatra` and `ghost` gems: `sudo gem install sinatra ghost` will do that for you.

Next, run `sudo rake install` then go to `http://driver.local` in your browser.

## Why is it broken?

Because it's currently in beta. If you'd like to beta test it, just follow the install instructions above. If you find something that is broken please file an issue.

## Known Bugs

When you're streaming music from your Mac machine to an Airport and you call a `ghost` command such as `rm` or `add` it will pause iTunes. Adding, modifying and deleting hosts does this. I don't know why.
