Driver is for setting up your passenger vhosts. Kind of like Passenger Pref Pane, but less hangy.

## Install

Run `sudo rake install` then go to `http://driver.local` in your browser.

## Why is it broken?

Because it's currently in beta. If you'd like to beta test it, just follow the install instructions above. If you find something that is broken please file an issue.
